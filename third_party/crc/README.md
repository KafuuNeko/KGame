## Platforms

Since the first version, the source code has been compiled and used on many platforms ranging from 8 bit micro controllers
to 64 bit multi core servers. Most platform dependent issues should therefore have been ironed out. Currently
the code is developed and maintained mainly in 32 bit and 64 bit environments. New versions of the code are
regularly compiled and checked on the systems mentioned in the following lists.

### 32 bit development environments
